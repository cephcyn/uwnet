<p>So what exactly is deep learning, anyway? The phrase is fairly vague and means different things to different people depending on who you talk to. First, though, it‚Äôs good to have a basic understanding of typical machine learning tasks and pipelines to understand how deep learning is different.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-tasks">Machine Learning Tasks</h2>

<p>Machine learning broadly is the task of modelling data, usually with some kind of numerical or statistical model. The first key distinction between machine learning tasks is between <strong>supervised</strong> and <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is function approximation.
    <ul>
      <li>Input:
        <ul>
          <li>data \(X\)</li>
          <li>function output or <strong>labels</strong> \(f(x)\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Learn: approximation \(h\) such that \(h(x) \approx f(x)\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong> is modelling the distribution of data
    <ul>
      <li>Input:
        <ul>
          <li>data \(X\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Learn:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>clusters</strong>: groupings of related data points</li>
          <li>a transformation to a different feature space that preserves relationships between data points</li>
          <li>a generating function or probability distribution \(g\) such that statistically \(X\) appears to be drawn from \(g\): \(X \sim g\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given data \(x\) and the output of running some function on the data, \(f(x)\), learn an approximation of the function \(f\).</p>

<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>I think of deep learning as having a few specific characteristics relative to typical machine learning.</p>

<h3 id="feature-extraction">Feature Extraction</h3>

<p>In ‚Äúnormal‚Äù machine learning there is an important phase known as feature extraction. The raw data must be converted to numerical or other ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù usable by a particular statistical modelling technique.</p>

<p>Typically deep learning is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neural network based</li>
  <li>Uses large amounts of data</li>
  <li>Incorporates feature extraction as part of the model
    <ul>
      <li>Has many ‚Äúlayers‚Äù of processing</li>
      <li>Early layers extract simple features from raw data</li>
      <li>Later layers extract complex features from simple features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Testing inline math \(a + b - \frac{10}{1}\) does it work?</p>

\[w = w - \eta \frac{d}{dw} L\]
