<p>So what exactly is deep learning, anyway? The phrase is fairly vague and means different things to different people depending on who you talk to. First, though, it‚Äôs good to have a basic understanding of typical machine learning tasks and pipelines to understand how deep learning is different.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-tasks">Machine Learning Tasks</h2>

<p>Machine learning broadly is the task of modelling data, usually with some kind of numerical or statistical model. The first key distinction between machine learning tasks is between <strong>supervised</strong> and <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is function approximation.
    <ul>
      <li>Input:
        <ul>
          <li>data \(X\)</li>
          <li><strong>labels</strong> \(Y\)</li>
          <li>paired examples \((x,y)\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assume:
        <ul>
          <li>there exists a function that maps from data to labels \(f: X \to Y\)</li>
          <li>our paired examples \((x,y)\) satisfy \(f(x) = y\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Learn: approximation \(h\) such that \(h(x) \approx f(x)\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong> is modelling the distribution of data
    <ul>
      <li>Input:
        <ul>
          <li>data \(X\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Learn:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>clusters</strong>: groupings of related data points</li>
          <li>a transformation to a different feature space that preserves relationships between data points</li>
          <li>a generating function or probability distribution \(g\) such that statistically \(X\) appears to be drawn from \(g\): \(X \sim g\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>Supervised learning encompasses algorithms for function approximation. Given a dataset \(X\) and a function \(f\) that takes elements of the dataset and produces output \(y = f(x)\), learn a function \(h\) such that \(h(x) \approx f(x)\).</p>

<p>This ‚Äúlabelling‚Äù function \(f\) can be obvious, like trying to predict the price of a car from attributes of the car like the make, model, year, mileage, condition, etc. In this case the true function \(f\) is the price a car salesman puts on the car given those attributes and we are trying to create an approximate function \(h\) that takes the same attributes and assigns a similar price.</p>

<p>For some tasks it can be more opaque, like predicting the weather from past days‚Äô weather. In the case of the weather, there is an underlying physical process but it is not a clear function that only takes as input the past days‚Äô weather. In reality, the weather is determined by a function (the unfolding of the laws of physics) acting on a set of data (the physical conditions of our planet).</p>

<p>In the case of weather prediction, the physical conditions of the planet are what‚Äôs known as a <strong>latent variable</strong> or hidden variable. They are not fully observed or recorded. Instead, we have variables $X$ and $Y$</p>

<p>I think of deep learning as having a few specific characteristics relative to typical machine learning.</p>

<h3 id="feature-extraction">Feature Extraction</h3>

<p>In ‚Äúnormal‚Äù machine learning there is an important phase known as feature extraction. The raw data must be converted to numerical or other ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù usable by a particular statistical modelling technique.</p>

<p>Typically deep learning is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neural network based</li>
  <li>Uses large amounts of data</li>
  <li>Incorporates feature extraction as part of the model
    <ul>
      <li>Has many ‚Äúlayers‚Äù of processing</li>
      <li>Early layers extract simple features from raw data</li>
      <li>Later layers extract complex features from simple features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Testing inline math \(a + b - \frac{10}{1}\) does it work?</p>

\[w = w - \eta \frac{d}{dw} L\]
